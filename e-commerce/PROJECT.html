                regulation rules regarding the use of online shopping food store</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Shop at known entities</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Any entity can be a known quantity if you do your homework. Instead of
                        looking at the Net as a sea of unrelated
                        competing entities, divide retailers into three subsets and attack each with a different
                        strategy.

                        The first group is brand-name brick-and-click retailers, known offline companies that have set
                        up shops online. The
                        advantage here is if you have a problem, you can always track down a live person. In the
                        worst-case scenario, you can
                        make a pilgrimage to the brick-and-mortar store, stomp your feet and if that does not get you
                        anywhere, set up a picket
                        line outside.

                        The second subset of stores online is cyber-only shops. By now, many of these shops have
                        established their own
                        reputation. Read the papers. Ask your friends.

                        The last — but certainly not the least — category of cyber shops are mom-and-pop ventures
                        online. These small cyber
                        shops stock unusual or hard-to-find items — one very good reason to shop the Net.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Set your own standards</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">As a rule, before I consider shopping at any cyber store, I look for a
                        toll-free number or e-mail address on the Web
                        site. If I can’t find this information easily, I move on. I don’t care if it is a well-known
                        retailer or an aromatherapy
                        dealer.

                        But rules are made to be broken. Set your own standards. Decide what risks you are willing to
                        take. If you find the
                        perfect gift or an unusual item at a relatively unknown Web site, take a chance.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Shop at secure sites</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Secure sites are encrypted or designed to prevent a third party from
                        seeing the information. Encryption scrambles
                        information or codes data that is transmitted. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard
                        “protocol” (method) to encrypt
                        data and authenticate users.

                        How do you know a site is secure? Many secure sites have an “s” after the “http:” in the URL
                        address. Some have pop-up
                        windows that let you know you are entering or exiting a secure site. Others have a special icon
                        to verify that the site
                        is secure.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Set your own standards>Pay with credit card
                        <p />
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Using a credit card remains the safest way to buy goods online. The
                        chance of stealing a credit-card number online is
                        less likely than someone rifling through your wastebasket for a brick-and-mortar receipt or
                        looking over your shoulder
                        at a brick-and-mortar checkout counter. It’s also relatively painless to contest charges that
                        are not yours or that are
                        unreasonable. If you have a good credit rating, most credit-card companies will attempt to
                        resolve the dispute as fast
                        as possible. On fraudulent charges, federal law limits your liability to $50.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Ask don't tell</h3>
                </li>
                <p>Remember the consumer — not the retailer — should be asking the questions. Some queries to consider
                    are: What is your
                    return policy? What are my shipping options? When can I expect delivery? Can I exchange or return
                    the product in a
                    brick-and-mortar store? If you find that a checkout form is requesting more information than your
                    federal tax form,
                    reconsider the purchase. In general, it’s a good policy to reveal as little personal information as
                    possible. If you
                    have to complete a form, answer only mandatory questions that are often highlighted with an
                    asterisk. No matter what you
                    do, don’t give out your Social Security number or mother’s maiden name to a retailer. There’s no
                    legitimate reason a
                    retailer needs to know this information. If a site is questionable, take the time to read its
                    privacy policy to
                    determine how the company uses the information gathered from the site.</p>

                    <p>Don't open unsolicited emails
                        <p />
                        <li />
                        Most shopping scams — and viruses — arrive in the mail. If you are not familiar with the sender,
                        don’t open the mail. To
                        help prevent future junk mail, SPAM and possible frauds, make sure you read the text carefully
                        in checkout areas before
                        you submit your order. Some companies automatically have checked a box that indicates your
                        desire to receive future
                        mailings. Unless you are confident that you want this mail, uncheck this box!

                <li>
                    <p>Look for a seal of approval
                        <p />
                </li>
                <p>An online seal of approval shows that a company maintains certain business practices and standards.
                    bbbonline.org, the
                    online arm of the Better Business Bureau, has a reliability seal, which indicates the business has
                    met BBB criteria for
                    truth-in-advertising and good customer service practices. Bbbonline.org also issues a privacy seal
                    that shows a company
                    stands behind its privacy statement.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Know where to file a complaint
                        </p>
                </li>
                <p>It’s always best if you can resolve your concerns directly with the retailer. But if you’re getting
                    nowhere fast,
                    consider filing a complaint with the bbbonline.org or truste.com.
                    Bbbonline.org handles complaints related to topics such as misleading advertising, non-delivery of
                    goods and services,
                    credit or billing problems. The agency does not handle complaints regarding employment practices and
                    discrimination.
                    <br>
                    You also can file a “watchdog complaint” at truste.com if the company has a TRUSTe trustmark and has
                    violated a privacy
                    issue. “It looked different on the Web site” is not a privacy issue. “I have asked to be removed
                    from a mailing list
                    three times without success” is a privacy issue. Truste.com moderates disputes between the consumer
                    and the company.
                    Unresolved issues are reported to the “appropriate law enforcement agencies.”
                    <br>
                    Serious disputes, such as criminal allegations, should be reported to the Bureau of Consumer
                    Protection at the Federal
                    Trade Commission. For cases of potential mail fraud, notify the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

                <p>In addition to snail mail and the telephone, the Federal Trade Commission’s Mail or Telephone Order
                    Rule applies to
                    orders by computer or fax. This ruling requires that the company ship an order within the time
                    stated in its
                    advertisements. If the company does not state any promised delivery times, the goods must be shipped
                    within 30 days of
                    receiving your order. Exceptions to the rule include magazine subscriptions, COD orders and delivery
                    of seeds and
                    growing plants.</p>
